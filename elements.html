    <!--HTML ELEMENTS-->
    <!--An html element contains a start tag and an end tag
    It is everything from the start tag to the end tag plus the content between the 
    start btag and the end tag. Some tags do not have contents between the start and the end tag,
    this is because these elements also have a single tag only, the opening tag, but they
    lack the closing tag, a good example is the <br> and the <img> elements.
    Such elements are called empty elements
    
    Elements in an html element are always nested within each other to make a document.-->
