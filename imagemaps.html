    <!--IMAGE MAPS-->
    <!--HTML image maps enable one to create clickable areas on an image
    An image map essentially enables you to perform various activities 
    on the same image but on different parts depending on where you click
    
    Insert an image using an <img> tag
    Use the usemap attribute to create the image map with #button at 
    the beginning of value name-->

    <img

      alt="African home"
      usemap="#africanhome"
    />

    <!--Map is then used to create an image map using the name attribute
    and the name given as value for usemap attribute as follows-->

    <!--Add a clickable area using the area element, and shape of the clickable area must be defined.
    You must also define some coordinates to be able to place clickable areas onto the image-->
