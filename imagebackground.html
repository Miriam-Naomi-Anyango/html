    <!--To add a background image, use the style attribute and the css background image property
    You can also specify the background image in the style element inserted inside the header section
    To prevent background repeat, use the background repeat property and set it to no repeat
    If you want the background to cover the whole element use the background size property and set it to cover
    Also to make sure the element is always covered use the background attachment property and set it to fixed-->

      I find  I often have to shout
      For Granny to hear what I'm talking absolute
      Her seemingly bright eyes at night
      Can not read or stare at the light
      She complains, and complains, and complains
      Toothache, headache, backache, joints pain
      The cup she's holding in her hand is the same one she's looking for under the bed
      Ooooh poor Granny
