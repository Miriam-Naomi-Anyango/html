    <!--IMAGES-->

    <!--IMAGE WIDTH & HEIGHT-->
    <!--To put width and height you can either use the style attribute or the width and height attribute
    To use style attribute, you must put pixels after the height whereas if you are using width and height attribute
    you don't have to put pixels after defined width or height value.
    
    It is however advisable to use the style attribute in defining width and height than using width and height so 
    that during styles you can avoid issues.-->
    <img
      src="/Assets/Red Flowers.jpg"
      alt="Red Flowers"
      style="width: 200px; height: 200px"

    <!--Images are used to add beauty to the site-->

    <!--To use image as link, put the image in an <a> tag-->

      I find I often have to shout
      For Granny to hear what I am talking about
      Her seemingly bright eyes at night
      Can not read or stare at the light
      And she complains and complains and complains
      Toothache, headache, backache.
      The cup she is holding now is the same one she is looking for under the bed.
      Ooooh my poor Granny!

    <img
      src="/Assets/Red Flowers.jpg"
      alt="Poem"
      style="float: right; height: 200px; width: 200px; margin-right: 500px; margin-bottom: 50px;"
    />
    </div>
   

    <!--BACKGROUND IMAGE-->
    <!--Used to design more a page, if you want a whole page to have background image
    define using the style attribute or your CSS with background image set for the whole body
  Note: If the background image is small, it will repeat itself horizontally and vertically until 
  it fits the size of the page, hence to prevent this repeat, define a CSS that says background-repeat
  and set its value to no repeat.
  
  If you want the background image to cover the whole size of the element, set background-size to Cover.
  If the image is small but you want to stretch it and force it to fit the size of the element
  the define the background size property and set it to 100% 100%-->

    <!--PICTURE ELEMENT-->
    <!--The picture element is used to display different images on different screen sizes.
  The picture element is important when it comes to bandwidth issues. As in it enebles 
  you display what is commensurate to the screensize being used currently.

  
  It is also important as it enables one to put more than one image format such that if a particular
  browser does not support a certain format of image then the one that is supported is the one 
  that will be displayed.-->
