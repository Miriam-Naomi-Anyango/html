    <!--THE ID ATTRIBUTE-->
    <!--The id attribute is also used in div and span elements but however, unlike
    the class attribute, id attribute can not be shared for more than one element.
    it is strictly unique for each element. It can also be used for bookmarking.
    The id attribute is case sensitive and is more prioritized than the class element
    where class element is available.-->

    <!--USING ID ATTRIBUTE IN BOOKMARKING-->
    <!--html bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage
    Bookmarks are especially useful when the page is too long.
    To use a bookmark you first have to create it and the add a link to it such that when
    one clicks of the link then it scrolls to the location with the bookmark
    The id attribute can also be used by javascript to manipulate specific elements using the 
    method getElementById-->
