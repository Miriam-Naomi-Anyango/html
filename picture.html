    <!--The picture element is important for two main reasons, the first one being
    to sort the bandwidth issue and a second reason is in cases where a browser does not support
    a particular image format, using the picture element helps the most compatible image format 
    to be displayed-->

    <!--Always use the <img> element as the last child element of the picture element
    This is especially important for browsers that don't support the picture element
    and or if none of the source tags match-->
